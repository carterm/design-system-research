# `ca-accordion`

Accordions are expandable sections of content. Each section contains a summary element and more body text when opened.

Accordions keep pages clean by hiding information that most people do not need to see.

Sample usage:

```html
<ca-accordion data-summary="My accordion">
  <p>My accordion content</p>
  <p>P1</p>
  <p>P2</p>
</ca-accordion>
```
